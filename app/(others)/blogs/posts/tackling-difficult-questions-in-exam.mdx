It’s inevitable that everyone will eventually face an exam
question that completely stumps you, and although these
questions might leave you questioning your knowledge on the
subject, I can promise you that when following the correct
strategies, you’ll be able to handle these daunting questions
with confidence.

Therefore, I leave with some tips that should help you put
yourself back on track.

## 1. Stay calm and composed

It might seem completely obvious at first, but it’s highly
common for people to panic when faced with a tough question.

This panic may very well cloud your thinking, and hinder your
ability to rationally solve a problem. When faced with such
questions, I urge you to lean back, unclench your fists, lower
your shoulders, and breath deeply.

Close your eyes if you have to, just for a moment, and when
you’ve returned to an open mind, confront the question once
more. Through this, you may see the question from a difficult
perspective and spark an idea that might help you solve it!

## 2. Read, and reread the question CAREFULLY

Too many times have I, and others, lost an intense number of
marks, simply because I read the question wrong.

This has led to a result of answering a completely separate
question. Remember, ensure you’re answering the question that’s
being asked, and not the question that you’d like to be asked.

Make sure to take a moment, and read each question extremely
question and ensure that you haven’t misinterpreted what’s being
asked. Do this by looking through each word/number, along with
keywords or phrases that associate to the question.

Examples of this include words such as “explain”, “compare”,
“calculate”, etc. These keywords at the start of questions might
completely change what’s being asked, and will alter your
response massively.

## 3. Break down the question

Sometimes, looking at a question as a whole can be worrisome and
therefore difficult to communicate. It’s important to break a
question down into manageable and less-worrying parts.

Attempt to locate main components and what each part might
actually require. Sometimes questions have different sections
that interpret different ideas, in which case, tackle each one
separately.

Often times, breaking questions down bit by bit can help
encourage logic and imaginative thinking, along with making a
question seem far less overwhelming and more approachable.

## 4. Plan your answer!

I say this primarily for questions requiring long answers,
however short answers are also included: Make sure to plan your
response beforehand! Although your time is considerably limited
in the exam, it’s important to plan what you’re going to write
in a separate section of the page.

You could quickly jot down notes in a bullet point format, or
draw out a mind map if you deem it necessary. Doing so will help
to organize your thoughts, and assist in structuring, promoting
logic, and ensuring full coverage of all required points, which
will allow you to develop a much higher quality answer.

## 5. Process of Elimination

Especially in multiple choice questions, but also in
mathematical, scientific, or essay questions, the process of
elimination can be vital towards pinpointing a correct answer,
and eliminating the potential of incorrect ideas.

When faced with difficult questions, you may start thinking of a
wide variety of responses, that may or may not be correct. In
often occasions, only one, or a few would be considered correct.

Therefore, attempt to eliminate evidently incorrect answers.
This can be done by pursuing part of an equation or response.

This will help to rat out the incorrect answers, leaving you
with a smaller selection that provides you the ability to make
educated guesses, or even develop new ideas to assist in
pinpointing a correct answer.

## 6. Show your work

Primarily in subjects like Math’s and Science, it’s extremely
important to show your work.

Not only do you often gain partial credit for showcasing a
correct path, even if your final answer was incorrect, but it
can also help you develop ideas for difficult questions.

If you know where to start, and you begin developing your
response, and you follow that by taking a step back and looking
over the course of your working out, you may be surprised to see
correlations that should help you in continuing that response
and eventually identifying a correct answer. Doing this will
also help you track your own thoughts, and catch any mistakes
along with the way.

## 7. Use relevant knowledge

If a question appears unfamiliar, such as a topic you don’t
think you’ve studied, then try to relate it to something you
have studied.

In some cases, aligning potentially relevant theories, formulas
or concepts you are aware of, can help you identify similarities
in the question you’re trying to answer. Doing so may help you
single out a potential solution!

## 8. Manage your time effectively

Please, and I say this with experience, manage your time wisely
at all costs. You’re provided a strict amount of time, which in
some situations may not be enough.

When faced with a difficult exam question, it might be wise to
skip it to ensure you don’t waste any time that could be spent
answering other questions and gaining more marks.

If you end up with more time at the end of answering, you could
return back to the question and utilize your remaining time on
answering it then.

You might also, due to you having answered other questions,
think of new concepts that will assist you in figuring out an
appropriate response.

It’s extremely important to remain confident in prioritizing
marks. Remember, you’re not answering questions for the sake of
answering questions, you’re answering them for the sake of
gaining marks.

## 9. Answer Every question

Unless you’re in an exam where you’re faced with penalties for
incorrect answers, may sure you respond to each question. An
educated guess is far better than leaving it blank.

If you go through an entire exam, and skip a few questions, go
back to them and guess if you have to. It’s highly possible that
you’ll pick up a few marks, even if it’s for a partial or
imperfect answer.

## Review your answers

If you have enough time, and you’ve answered every question, do
yourself a favor and review each answer.

Attempt to seek mistakes or incomplete answers throughout your
paper. It’s possible that by revisiting your work, you might
gain a fresh perspective and identify errors or develop ideas to
help you gain some more last-minute marks.

## Conclusion

Battling difficult exam questions can be tricky, aggravating and
stressful.

But by remaining calm, thinking with an open mind, and applying
strategic and educated thought, along with breaking down
questions, planning responses, and managing your time
effectively, you too can become a master examination taker.

With this advice, I hope that your confident and your
performance will be boosted.

Every question will affect your mark, so answer it to the best
of your ability. Strive for marks, any way how.

Good luck!
