                Procrastination often is caused from fears of failure
                perfectionism or just genuinely feeling overwhelmed if
                you&apos;re able to identify the root cause then it should

                perhaps SMART goals might be helpful. This stands for Specific,
                Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time Bound. Clear

                One thing that works for me is if you go to settings on your

                There are many focus techniques that are beneficial, one of
                which I prioritize is the Pomodoro technique. You can find this
                technique in the r/alevel discord, and it basically allows you

                50-minute study and 10-minute break intervals.

                This technique can help you to maintain high levels of focused

                <strong>Time Blocking: </strong>

                dedicated to a specific task or a specific activity. This can
                help you to allocate equal amounts of time per day to each task,

                studying. Whether it&apos;s achieving good grades, getting into
                a dream university, or pursuing a career goal, keeping your

                Physical activity helps to boost brain function, reduce stress,

                proteins. Try to avoid excessive caffeine or sugary snacks,
