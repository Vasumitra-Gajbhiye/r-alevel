As an A-Level student, you’re probably focused more on your
studies and exams. However, something that you and other A-Level
students all want, is to get into university.

Unfortunately, a full focus on studies and exams isn’t the only
thing that you need to get in. There’s a lot more to being
successful than simply hitting books and knowing a specific
subjects.

You need to know how to apply that subject to the real world.

Volunteering and experience could provide you with a vast number
of benefits outside the classroom, which can shape your skills,
characters and future opportunities.

Ensuring your active outside of school can help universities
identify the type of person you are and may even make you a more
ideal candidate.

## 1. Real world skills and experience

**Practical application:** If in-person experience
is more your style, then pursuing volunteering and work
experience could provide hands-on opportunities to apply skills
that you’ve learnt during your studies.

This experience might revolve around problem-solving, teamwork
or communication.

But overall, these experiences can help boost your skillset and
create a work-mind to help you progress both academically, and
in a real-world setting.

**Skill development:** Both volunteering and work
placements can help you to develop a vast number of practical
skills such as project management, customer service, and other
technical abilities depending on the nature of the work.

These skills not only help you in your day-to-day life, but they
are also transferrable towards boosting your resume.

**Professional insight:** By partaking in such
experience, you’ll be exposed to industries and roles you might
be keen to join in the future.

By doing such activities, you’ll develop a better understanding
of the career paths available and their environments. This might
end up helping you in making more informed decisions regarding
your future studies and career goals.

## 2. Enhanced university applications

**Stand out from the crowd:** Believe it or not,
but not everyone conducts voluntary work experience.

Universities in many cases seek people with such experience –
much like jobs do.

By doing such activities, it can help set you apart by
showcasing your intent, commitment, initiative, and the ability
to manage responsibility outside of academics.

**Showcase skills and achievements:** Partaking in
such experiences can help to showcase skills and accomplishments
that you might have achieved during your time.

Having such achievements can provide you with things to talk
about during a statement or interview. By highlighting such
projects and achievements, it can both strengthen your
application and differ your personal view towards peers.

**Relevant experience:** Primarily for courses that
idealize practical and specific skills such as medicine or law,
performing relevant volunteering can be extremely valuable. This
is because it showcases your genuine interest in the field.

## 3. Personal growth and development

**Boosted confidence:** By taking on this sort of
challenges in a work setting, it can majorly boost your
confidence.

When you successfully complete a task, it can help to build
self-esteem and resilience as you become fonder of such
environments outside of your comfort zone.

**Expanded perspective:** Voluntary interaction,
especially in areas that are different to your lifestyle or
other diverse groups that face different challenges, can help to
expand your personal perspective on the world.

It helps to broaden your view, enhance your empathy for others,
and possibly improves your ability to work with others.

**Increased responsibility:** By handling
real-world tasks and responsibility, it might even foster a
sense of accountability and professionalism.

Doing so can help create perspective on your own actions. They
also help you in managing time, prioritizing tasks, and handling
pressure in a much more effective manner.

## 4. Networking and connections

**Building professional relationships:** Volunteering and working in different places can be a major
beneficial factor towards meeting new people.

You’re able to connect with professionals, mentors, and peers
within a similar field of interest. These relations can be
extremely valuable when attempting to locate future
opportunities or gain future career connections.

**Gain references and connections:** Strong
performance within these workplaces can lead to your peers
providing you references.

These factors are vital towards showing employers or
universities that other people were able to rely on and trust
you.

## 5. Clarify career goals

**Explore career options:** By gaining experience
in different roles and industries beforehand, you’ll be able to
gain insight on potential careers you could strive for.

Doing so can help you explore what peaks your interests, and
what bests align with your skills. Remember, align yourself with
an industry you enjoy!

**Confirm your interests:** Volunteering and work
experience can help confirm or challenge what you’re aspiring to
do. If you manage to discover a passion for a particular field,
then great! Pursue it.

But you might also find a certain path that you originally
liked, but learned you dislike when you went on the path. It’s
best to make these discoveries early on.

## 6. Contribute to the community

**Make a positive impact:** By volunteering, you’ll
be provided the opportunity to support the community you’re
apart of.

This can provide you with a sense of purpose and might very well
be fulfilling and self-rewarding!

**Develop a sense of civic responsibility:** Engaging in a community can help foster a sense of duty and responsibility.

This teaches you the values of contributing towards the
well-being of others, along with the intense importance of
community engagement.

## Conclusion

or work experience are more than just some resume boosters.

They offer genuine real-world skills and personal growth, along
with insight on your idealized career.

By investing time into these things, you’ll both enhance your
applications, clarify your goals, and develop a vast set of
skills that, 10 years down the line, you’ll seriously thank
yourself for.

Embrace this sort of opportunities a gain a more rounded
experience during your A-Level journey!
